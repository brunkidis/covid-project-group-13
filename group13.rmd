### Group 13's Goals

Our group chose to analyze two different trends in the data from JHU's Covid Dataset, both trying to evaluate correlation, but one looking at data over time, and the other as a summary to date.

1. For our first hypothesis we wanted to test if major holidays or turning points contributed to a rise in the number of cases of coronavirus in the US.

2. For our second hypothesis we wanted to analyze how a region's political affiliation impacted an individual's likelihood to have contracted or been exposed to coronavirus.
